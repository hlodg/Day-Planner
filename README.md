# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
This calendar creates a work day schedule which lays out the information for a daily schedule. This enables the user to create a plan for thier day. 

## User Story
A typical user of this product would want to lay out thier daily schedule. They would create a schedule daily in order to help thier employer know where they are. The key about this product is that it shows the different times based on color choice. If the event has passed, it displays a different color that event. The present event allows the user to see where they should be at that particular moment. 

##Challenges
In creating this product, the difficulty came when storing the information. Currently the events get saved on local storage and inputted into the calendar when it is refreshed and opened on that device. It would be great to in the future create the same thing but that has a global storage feature.
